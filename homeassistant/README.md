# Home Network Monitor integration configuration for Home Assistant
After integration is installed to Home Assistant, you can configure it to secure your network.
One way to analyze the data from integration is to use Home Assistant Conversation agent.
I'm using the [Ollama integration with llama3.2 model](yaml/automation.yml).

Automation gives me a short report about my network current situation.
